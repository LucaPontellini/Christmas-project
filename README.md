# 🎄 Christmas-Project 🎄

Welcome to the **Christmas-Project**! This project is designed to create a comprehensive data collection system to manage users and the cashier in a casino environment. The primary goal is to develop a robust system that can handle user information efficiently, with the potential to expand and support more users in the future.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **Christmas-Project** integrates seamlessly with another existing project, [Ponte's Casino](https://github.com/LucaPontellini/End-of-Year-Project-for-Computer-Science-Poker-.git). The data file is managed exclusively by the casino owner, who has the credentials to access and manage user information securely.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **User Management**: Efficiently handle user information, including registration, login, and balance management.
- **Cashier Management**: Manage cashier operations and transactions within the casino.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with [Ponte's Casino](https://github.com/LucaPontellini/End-of-Year-Project-for-Computer-Science-Poker-.git) for a unified user experience.
- **Security**: Ensure that user data is securely managed and accessible only by authorized personnel.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For enhancing interactivity and user experience.
- **JSON**: For data storage and management.
